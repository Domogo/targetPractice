# targetTap

#### TargetTap is a simple android game fully playable on android devices. Sorry Apple, not sorry.

#### Purpose
The sole purpose of this game's existence was for it's creator (me.. duhh) to fully experience the game dev process:
- coming up with the idea
- creating game assets
- developing the game
- publishing it
- being thrown into hell because of all the bugs I failed to catch

Make sure you have the "allow unknown sources" option enabled on your device.
